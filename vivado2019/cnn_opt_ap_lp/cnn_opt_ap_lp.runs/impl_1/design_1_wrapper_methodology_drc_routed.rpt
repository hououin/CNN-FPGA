TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.804 ns between design_1_i/cnn_0/inst/grp_conv_2_fu_5065/add_ln1192_99_fu_9960_p2/CLK (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/cnn_0/inst/grp_conv_2_fu_5065/phi_ln1117_40_reg_6272_pp0_iter11_reg_reg[13]_psdsp_3/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
